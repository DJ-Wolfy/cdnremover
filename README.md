 chrome extension to remove cdn media alt text from images in reddit
# why?
A few weeks ago I made a post on reddit regarding a glaring accessibility issue. Images had useless alt text attached, and so google did not send OCR descriptions for them.
This simple chrome extensions can be used in any chromium browser and fixes the issue completely by removing this alt text. As a result, google sends back to you the alt text description and you can continue browsing images as usual. I found it useful and thought others might to, I've decided to share it here on github
# how to use
1: clone this repository or download it to your local machine
either type in the command line if you have git:
git clone https://github.com/dj-wolfy/cdnremover
or,
press the button which reads "code button collapsed"
it will expand and a "download zip" link will appear
Once downloaded unpack it
Now, go into your prefered browser and type this:
chrome://extensions
check the developer mode toggle button, and click load unpacked, and go to the folder in which the extension is stored. Select the folder, and it should be loaded.
Enjoy!
